<P>
High intensity training means short-term training under maximum stress. 
With high intensity training, the effect of training is as high or higher than with long periods of training at medium or low intensity

The period of intense exercise can vary from less than 45 seconds to a few minutes. People then rest or do gentle exercise for a similar time frame before 
repeating the sequence.
An entire HIIT workout may be as short as 15â€“20 minutes, but it provides a wide range of benefits. Its short duration can make it a very practical and effective
choice for people who find it difficult to commit to longer sessions.
It also requires no equipment or gym membership, so people can do it anywhere at a time that suits them.
